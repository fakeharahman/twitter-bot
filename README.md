# twitter-bot

This is the code for a twitter bot that retweets a certain hashtag at regular intervals. It has been customized for heroku hosting.

# To run on local machine

Add a config.js file at the root folder with you consumer keys and access token.
In the app.fs file, uncomment the config import and delete all the "Process.env" and the "const config" varible.
Type "Npm start" on your terminal.

I will soon publish it so that it can run directly on the local machine without much changes.
